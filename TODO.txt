1) Change RectangleShape on your own class, add type for every tile
2) Spawn army -> army got pos of dest -> check if army intersects with any road type tile ->
if so change army pos and check if dest become lower -> if so okey
if not get army back and try another, but always search for best solution
3) maybe think about fortress or towers
4) also nesseccary to create building zone for every city, so player will not buil on tile all over the map
(maybe add some mask on rects (0,0,0, (0-255)) play with last parm in sf::Color
5)...
